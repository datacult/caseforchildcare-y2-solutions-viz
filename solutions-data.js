We really wanted to solve for the gap in primary care. Then the ROI comes into play because when someone can't show up at work, there's operational pressure. This pilot proved to release that pressure, providing consistency and stability in our workforce.” - Danelle McCusker, UPS\n\n“There was a really interesting pilot in Boston with the construction trades: the Care That Works campaign. It focused on getting more women into the trades, which involved helping them get access to care on the hours they need to be available. One of the biggest issues that they ran into was it's really hard to find care that's open early in the morning and then when they do manage to find it, it's absurdly expensive. So the pilot provides wrap-around services for early hour child care.” - Carmi Medoff, Onsite Kids",

So, the business community got together with Let’s Grow Kids and they came up with a few ways to forge a new revenue stream towards childcare solutions. They passed a 0.44% payroll tax, which businesses supported, to deposit into the Child Care Contribution Special Fund. Childcare supports are not just the right thing for the educational foundation of the youngest learners, but it also makes good business sense to invest in childcare, and to make sure that all stakeholders are at the table to ensure structural systemic improvement.” - Aaron Merchen, Chamber of Commerce",

To help employers budget, in the updated version of this program, they’re trying to set a floor and ceiling to a sliding scale model that more employees can take advantage of who might not necessarily qualify for the government benefit. \n\nOregon passed the CHIPS Child Care Fund that builds on existing state child care programs that could support businesses in unlocking federal funds through the federal CHIPS and Science Act.\n\nIndiana has awarded $25 million to employer-sponsored childcare grants. Forty employers plan to provide on-site childcare to their employees, and 15 will offer childcare tuition benefits to their workers. The remaining awardees plan to support childcare for their employees in a variety of other ways, such as reserving seats at partner childcare centers.",

Instead, the hub will show that we have these 20 slots in our county, and you can see where they're located based on where you live and where you work.
